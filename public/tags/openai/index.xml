      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s edition of &amp;lsquo;I told ye so, so I did!&amp;rsquo; is this post about FauxpenAI pulling access to a model of theirs and, oh ooops, there goes the reproducibility of more than a hundred papers who use the model. Soz.
That is, a critical piece of research infrastructure is privatised and entirely at the whims of some like product strategist in a turtleneck and leggings e-scootering in to their SV office.</description>

      <description>OpenAI have probably sullied the word &amp;lsquo;open&amp;rsquo; now for good. As this Twitter thread shows they&amp;rsquo;re anything but. More like FauxpenAI amirite?? Imagine publishing a 94 page-ML paper and not even describe, let alone publish, your training data. Sad!
But it shows we need independent organisations who collect and give access to trustworthy training data. Which is of course no news to anyone familiar with the Open Data Institute&amp;rsquo;s great work on data institutions.</description>
