      <description>My great-grandfather was Louis J. Walsh. This article in the Dictionary of Irish Biography holds as much information as I know about him. He had a pretty active life. He was part of the early 20th-century Irish Republican movement, had a stint in Ballykinlar interment camp, wrote quite a bit of fiction and non-fiction and was even the first district judge appointed by the new Irish state.
My aunt recently sent me an essay he had published in The Derry Journal in 1931.</description>
