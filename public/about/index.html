<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<p>I am Fionntán and I am an AI and data technologist.</p>
<p><strong>Nerd alert! A technologist&hellip;you can&hellip;read minds??</strong></p>
<p>No, but I can read very long and dry reports about data and AI and make them understandable to actual humans! Given the amount of spoofers, gombeens and shitehawks in the tech space, I think a trusty, friendly feller like myself, who&rsquo;s been around the block, is probably worth something.</p>
<p><strong>What are these &lsquo;blocks&rsquo; you speak of?</strong></p>
<p>Probably handiest to take a <a href="https://fionntan.github.io/markdown-cv/">look at th&rsquo;on CV</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You were at the BBC? Were you Henry Sellers? Did you scream &lsquo;I made the BBC!&rsquo;?</strong></p>
<p>No. But Spike Lee did walk past my desk once, that was pretty exciting. And I was involved in moving recommendations in to more modern vector-based ML approach. And in a cool group getting AI ethics off the ground. I was there, man!</p>
<p><strong>Far out. And the Open Data Institute? Is open data still cool? Isn&rsquo;t it very 2012??</strong></p>
<p>Well the ODI is more about data in its entirety and <em>opening</em> data. And being open about about all the stuff you&rsquo;re doing with data. Which is what challenged my very feeble machine learning engineer brain. I sauntered in going &lsquo;yeah, yeah, I know everything about data, I once used a 100GB dataset, get outta my way&rsquo;, and then ohhh nooo realising I was like a doe-eyed child when it came to data protection, data policy, data governance, data audits, data privacy&hellip;the list goes on really. I&rsquo;m happy to say I know a lot more now. And have some happy memories of the lovely folks at the ODI.</p>
<p><strong>You know, I still don&rsquo;t know what a technologist is.</strong></p>
<p>I know it sounds a bit vague but I like &ldquo;technologist&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s like a big old pot of stew of different skills in and around tech. It&rsquo;s software engineering, research, design, communication. So you&rsquo;re as comfortable doing a user needs interview as giving a workshop as crafting an algorithm. It can be an odd intersection at times but I&rsquo;m happy to be there.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s happening now?</strong></p>
<p>I advise the public service about how to improve how they use data. Both on the – let&rsquo;s please not do bad stuff! – side and the – all right, let&rsquo;s get damn data to work! – side. Usually this involves recommending lot of smaller projects to improve data quality, cataloguing, modelling, identifying roles, all that shite. The huge unsung grunt work that results in lovely data viz and snazzy insights and high salaries for AI engineers.</p>
<p><strong>But AI is hip now! It&rsquo;s the hashtag zeitgeist!</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in some kind of strange space where 99% of tech chat is about AI but only a tiny sliver of organisations have the data in place to attempt it. Few people try to bring this all together and consider the full chain – from data to insights to decisions – and which parts of this to automate.</p>
<p><strong>Well that&rsquo;s super. Oh, just one more question. Do you live in a very remote and beautiful part of Ireland with an abundance of epic vistas and nice people?</strong></p>
<p>Wow, what an on-point question, it&rsquo;s like you know me. Yes I live in Donegal, Ireland. It&rsquo;s fab, check it out some time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some nice cows I saw one time I was trying to spot Pearse Brosnan and Gabriel Byrne shoot a movie on Narin beach.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fionnt%C3%A1n-o-donnell-93b3099b/">LinkedIn</a> – did you ever actually scroll down on the LinkedIn feed? An absolutely bonkers place. But useful for messaging work ones and taking a squint at CVs.</li>

<h2 id="some-things-ive-written-which-i-still-quite-like">Some things I&rsquo;ve written which I still quite like</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/bbc-news-labs/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-fair-ai-8c72204f0798">What we talk about when we talk about fair AI</a> – I remember in 2015 being in some big ML conference and there were about 800 people in the main auditorium for a deep learning algo-talk and about 13 people in some pokey little room upstairs at the second <a href="https://www.fatml.org/schedule/2015">Fairness, Accountability &amp; Transparency in Machine Learning workshop</a>. This doesn&rsquo;t feel riiiight&hellip;I thought. So in my very own limited way I tried to push these developing ideas within the BBC. I hadn&rsquo;t really written anything of this length before for work and apologies to my manager as I completely slacked off other projects I was meant to be on. Anyway, still reads well.</li>
<li><a href="https://theodi.org/article/sharing-models-between-digital-twins/">Sharing models between ‘digital twins’</a> – Covid, economy, climate – models are a pretty big deal. They&rsquo;re also a bit mad, you put data in, data comes out, they kind of <em>are</em> data. But if they&rsquo;re going to be shared around they need to be well-documented. This uses digital twins as a starting point to think about how to document models.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/dTlVo8Xim-4">With great personal data comes great anonymity</a> – talk I gave at the Open Data Institute on maintaining trust while anonymising data.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theodi/synthetic-data-tutorial">Hands-on synthetic data tutorial for programmers</a> – this was a great combination of both writing and development work. It&rsquo;s got quite a few Github stars too which makes me feel nice.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kYdKnB2-wyXN1iW4ZaJbNt2ClwcQApoLMwiVUQRhk2g/edit#slide=id.gacb68ed590_0_0">Designing data audits to build trust</a> - an annotated slidedeck. People are going, we need to audit data and AI! All right, but how! There&rsquo;s so much to consider in audits and making everyone involved trust them. This wrapped those questions up in a visually appealing package. Also, if you look at the speaker notes at the bottom of the slides there&rsquo;s links to lots of great stuff.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theodi/nso-stats-fetcher/blob/main/analysis.md">Comparing inflation data publishing across countries</a> – you know the way inflation is a big deal right now? You&rsquo;d expect that info to be easily available in nice data formats. You&rsquo;d be completely wrong. It&rsquo;s a bonkers completely messy world of data publishing. It was <em>extremely</em> hard to make one puny graph using national statistics websites&rsquo; data.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theodi/data-publish-list">How to publish open data: a list of advice and tools</a> – a lot of the time in my job I just feel I&rsquo;m taking great material elsewhere and pointing people towards it. But it actually takes a lot of time to collect and curate these. Basically a middleman for knowledge. Middlemen are important! I still refer back to these links often.</li>
