In today's edition of 'I told ye so, so I did!' is this [post about FauxpenAI pulling access to a model of theirs](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/openais-policies-hinder-reproducible) and, oh ooops, there goes the reproducibility of more than a hundred papers who use the model. Soz.

That is, a critical piece of research infrastructure is privatised and entirely at the whims of some like product strategist in a turtleneck and leggings e-scootering in to their SV office. "Oh my Dogecoin stock is down 10%, I better dopamine-fast and exponentially profit on our AI moat!" they probably say.

Anyway, go read Sayash and Arvind as they are 100x smarter than moron me.

The post does mention open [large language model BLOOM](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom), which is inspiring.

> "This is the culmination of a year of work involving over 1000 researchers from 70+ countries and 250+ institutions"..."training the BLOOM model on the Jean Zay supercomputer in the south of Paris, France thanks to a compute grant worth an estimated €3M from French research agencies CNRS and GENCI."

You're talking millions of euro and one huge collaboration to create this language model. You could imagine say like a CERN of large models existing – kind of like some factory of factories – hugely expensive to build the big factory, but small and cheap to let other orgs to use the output and go off and run their own.

How to create more of these? Sure listen, what do I know about industrial strategy. Get the Mariana Mazzucatos of this world on the phone.

But think of the opportunities for public and private orgs if we're rolling out open and trustworthy AI models in health, energy, transport, etc. These can be continuously maintained and improved with the right funding, collaboration and governance if the state grows up and put on their AI big-boy pants(/big-girl skirt/big person trousers).
