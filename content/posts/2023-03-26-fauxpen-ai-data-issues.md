OpenAI have probably sullied the word 'open' now for good. [As this Twitter thread shows](https://twitter.com/benmschmidt/status/1635692487258800128) they're anything but. More like FauxpenAI amirite?? Imagine publishing a 94 page-ML paper and not even _describe_, let alone publish, your training data. Sad!

But it shows we need independent organisations who collect and give access to trustworthy training data. Which is of course no news to anyone familiar with [the Open Data Institute's great work on data institutions](https://www.theodi.org/article/what-do-we-mean-by-data-institutions/).

But let's go a step further here. There can (and should!) be AI institutions. Independent bodies with a public mandate that maintain and release not just data, but AI code, models and APIs. Then small organisations, public and private who don't have the compute or tech skills, can build services on top, benefiting everyone.

Imagine a semi-state body whose sole job was to make an Irish-language ChatGTP â€“ (CaintTG4 ðŸ˜€??). And you could submit new data sources to it. Or raise git issues in the code. That'd be fairly cool in my book ("How to Make Cool and Good Public AI by FionntÃ¡n O'Donnell Esq.")

Instead of just relying on big tech to drop these from the sky, perhaps we use our powerful collective resources to drive the direction of big AI models.
