# Yes there!

**Who are you?**

I am Fionntán and I am an AI and data technologist.

**Nerd alert! A techologist...you can...read minds??**

No, but I can read very long and dry reports about data and AI and make them understandable to actual humans! Given the amount of spoofers, gombeens and shitehawks in the tech space, I think a trusty, friendly feller like myself, who's been around the block, is probably worth something. 

**What are these 'blocks' you speak of?**

Probably handiest to take a [look at th'on CV](https://fionntan.github.io/markdown-cv/). 

**Were you the tech Henry Sellers? Did you make the BBC?**

No. But Spike Lee did walk past my desk once, that was pretty exciting.

**Did he explain what a technologist is?**

I know it sounds a bit vague but I like the term technologist because it's a big old stew of different skills in and around tech. It's a funny junction of software engineering, research, design, communication. It can be an odd intersection at times but he’s happy to be there.

**Do you live in a very remote and beautiful part of Ireland with an abundance of epic vistas and nice people?**

Wow, what an on-point question, it's like you know me. Yes I live in Donegal, Ireland. It's fab, check it out some time.

## Me on de socials

- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.ie/@fionntan) – the fodiverse
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fionnt%C3%A1n-o-donnell-93b3099b/) – did you ever actually scroll down on the LinkedIn feed? An absolutely bonkers place. But useful for messaging work ones and taking a squint at CVs.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fionntan) – admittedly Twitter has a fierce bang of 'wouldn't be caught dead in the place' these days, but sure listen, if you need me, I'll be about.

## Some things I've written which I still quite like

- [What we talk about when we talk about fair AI](https://medium.com/bbc-news-labs/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-fair-ai-8c72204f0798) – I remember in 2015 being in some big ML conference and there were about 800 people in the main auditorium for a deep learning algo-talk and about 13 people in some pokey little room upstairs at the second [Fairness, Accountability & Transparency in Machine Learning workshop](https://www.fatml.org/schedule/2015). This doesn't feel riiiight...I thought. So in my very own limited way I tried to push these developing ideas within the BBC. I hadn't really written anything of this length before for work and apologies to my manager as I completely slacked off other projects I was meant to be on. Anyway, still reads well. 
- [Sharing models between ‘digital twins’](https://theodi.org/article/sharing-models-between-digital-twins/) – Covid, economy, climate – models are a pretty big deal. But if they're going to be shared around they need to be well-documented. This uses digital twins as a starting point to think about how to document models. 
- [With great personal data comes great anonymity](https://youtu.be/dTlVo8Xim-4) – talk I gave at the Open Data Institute on maintaining trust while anonymising data. 
- [Sharing models for Covid-19: guidance and tools](https://theodi.org/article/sharing-models-for-covid-19-guidance-and-tools/) – More models! But this time about covid. Remember all those graphs people had and what that meant for your weekend?? Mad. 
- [Hands-on synthetic data tutorial for programmers](https://github.com/theodi/synthetic-data-tutorial) – this was a great combination of both writing and development work. It's got quite a few Github stars too which makes me feel nice.
