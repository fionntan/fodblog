> Mainly, it's about the likely future of state decision making through modelling.  Take three huge topics where predictive modelling is prevalent – covid, the economy and the climate. A lot of decision making in these domains seems to be "well we'd like to do X, but if we do X then ours models say Y will happen – so the only course of action is Z" (Z being lockdowns, austerity, some government over or under-reach). And because the general public don't have the knowledge or skills or access we kind of have to accept the apparent recommendation of 'the model' without much ability to cogently rebut or protest.

> It seems models are the next step up again in to technocracy. It's not just unaccountable technocrats, it's technocrats relying on data experts who in turn rely on models. This process get even further out of reach as states roll-out extremely complex AI techniques for entirely automated decisions making –the AI says you shouldn't get welfare. So the elected politician doesn't understand the advisor who doesn't understand the data scientist who doesn't understand the model but they all still obey its decisions.

> But where to go from all this? Don't use large amounts of data? Only use interpretable models? And whose interpretation anyway?
