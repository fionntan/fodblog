Little bit a' finance humour there in the title. #hip

Ah, the FT. Those free wheelin' hippies. Much like everyone and their b-hole they have opinions on AI ethics. _"Receive free AI ethics updates"_ their newsletter signup proclaims. Their [`ai-ethics`](https://www.ft.com/ai-ethics) tagged content makes me think otherwise.

But, in particular, the columnist Stephen Bush[^1] does in his piece this week.  He's writing about the use of AI (AKA THE ALGORITHM) in the justice system. 

[The algorithms of justice involve unpalatable trade-offs](https://www.ft.com/content/dc1d68f4-1b2c-4a78-8cf8-172525121ef6) - _Financial Times, 11 Apr 2023_

This falls right in to this blog's interest in all wings of the state using data and tech to make better (but accountable!) decisions.

Let's look at some parts of it.

> One of the things that makes policymaking easier in the modern world is that we know more.

This is a very deep question when you think about it. Maybe you can access to too much information and conflicting opinions and you're stuck in a state of paralysis. Maybe judges are overloaded with complex inner workings of models, or presented with terabytes of data on case files. More data does not make impactful decision making easier. It's the _correct presentation_ of that knowledge of that information to a person who is trained to handle that information format that is key.

In the next bit, I like that Stephen gets us to consider the judicial process as a dumbed-down form of algorithmic decision making. In the rush to hype and criti-hype AI, people are losing track that states have been making really impactful decisions about citizens since...I don't know...let's say the Mesopotamians, as that's very long ago. AI is a step-change, but let's put it in context, people. 

> Sentencing guidelines are, in many ways, the most common form of “algorithm” in use in public policy today, although we don’t often think of them this way. We run a series of data points — the nature of the crime, the circumstances of the offence, various biographical details about the offender and the victim — into the machine to produce a set of options for the presiding judge to consider.

It ends with a standard enough call for transparency here – "to discuss plainly what trade-offs are involved". The 'plainly' is the key point for me here. Plain to whom?[^2]. Whether the judge is the algorithm, or it's an algorithm-informed judge, we're still being asked to make decisions – was justice served – about some decision making. 

> One temptation for governments will be to have those debates behind closed doors: to be vague about what the data tells us and to keep adjusting algorithms in private. But one benefit of the era of big data is the ability to reach decisions in a more deliberative fashion — to discuss plainly what trade-offs are involved. 

Worth a read of the whole thing[^3] as I haven't done it..._justice_... here.

[^1]: I've a very visceral memory of living in London and regularly listening to him and Helen Lewis on the New Statesman podcast during the whole Theresa May election meltdown thing. It was a hot summer and I did a lot of cycling in to the BBC News building in Oxford Circus. It's maybe a shame Stephen joined the columnist class as he was just a straight-up very good reporter. Sadly, columnists for some very unfair reason (probably around anger-clicks) get paid more and who can blame anyone for going for more wonga and prestige for less effort. 

[^2]: Knock knock. Who's there? To. To who? To whom!
